**ðŸ“¦ Product: Fish and Pearl Oxidized Classic Earrings (SKU: TEX0246XTY)**
**Recommendation:** Increase stock by 20 units.
**Reasoning:**
â€¢ **Detailed stock analysis with numbers:** Currently has insufficient data to determine stock levels, but given the exceptionally high sales velocity (47 units sold), a significant stock increase is warranted to avoid stockouts.
â€¢ **Sales velocity and trend analysis:**  The product has sold 47 units, generating â‚¹62893 in revenue. This indicates extremely high demand.  There's no data on stock levels to analyze trend beyond this single high-performing period.
â€¢ **Financial calculation (revenue, costs in â‚¹):**  Revenue of â‚¹62893 is already generated. Assuming a 20% profit margin (this needs verification with actual cost data), the profit is â‚¹12578.60. Increasing stock by 20 units, even with a slight increase in cost, will likely yield substantial additional profit based on current demand.
â€¢ **Market opportunity assessment:** The high sales velocity suggests a significant market opportunity.  Meeting this demand will strengthen brand reputation and customer loyalty.
â€¢ **Customer demand insights:** The high sales volume and positive sales trend (assuming that 47 units were sold in a relatively short period) strongly indicate high customer demand.

**ðŸ“Œ Simple Steps:**
1. Order 20 additional units of TEX0246XTY.
2. Maintain current pricing to capitalize on high demand.
3. Feature this product prominently on the homepage and in relevant email marketing campaigns.
4. Track sales velocity daily to adjust stock levels as needed.

**ðŸ“¦ Product: Nera CZ Gold Plated Hand Chain (SKU: TBX0012XC2 & TBX0012XD2)**
**Recommendation:** Investigate SKU discrepancies and consolidate stock.
**Reasoning:**
â€¢ **Detailed stock analysis with numbers:**  Two SKUs (TBX0012XC2 and TBX0012XD2) appear to be identical products with a combined 48 units sold for a total revenue of â‚¹46032. This suggests a potential inventory management error with duplicate SKUs.
â€¢ **Sales velocity and trend analysis:** The combined sales velocity is high (48 units sold). This points to a popular product, but the duplicated SKUs are hindering accurate inventory tracking and reporting.
â€¢ **Financial calculation (revenue, costs in â‚¹):** A total revenue of â‚¹46032 was generated from both SKUs.  Profit calculation requires cost data.
â€¢ **Market opportunity assessment:** High sales suggest a significant market opportunity, but the SKU issue is hindering the ability to fully capitalize on it.
â€¢ **Customer demand insights:** High sales indicate strong customer interest, but the duplicate SKUs need immediate attention to ensure accurate order fulfillment and sales data.

**ðŸ“Œ Simple Steps:**
1. Merge the two SKUs (TBX0012XC2 and TBX0012XD2) into a single SKU.
2. Maintain the current pricing.
3. Update product descriptions and images to ensure consistency.
4. Monitor sales and stock levels for the consolidated SKU.

**Recommendation:** Investigate the dye problem and decide whether to salvage, discount, or discard the product.

â€¢ **Sales velocity and trend analysis:** Zero sales due to the quality issue.
â€¢ **Financial calculation (revenue, costs in â‚¹):**  Zero revenue. Costs are unknown but significant due to the production and inventory holding.
